This project uses the Markov Chain to simulate a supermarket. The transitions of customers \
from one location to another with timestamps is used to generate a transition matrix with \
probabilities. Based on those probabilities the simulation of customers in a supermarket  \
has been realized. In this project the main focus was on sales based on bought and stolen  \
articles.


## Installation

The requirements file contains all necessary packages used for the simulation.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The csv files need to be etracted into a data folder which is located in the same layer as 
the python files.

Download: [csv-files]()

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```
