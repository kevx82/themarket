This project uses the Markov Chain to simulate a supermarket. The transitions of customers \
from one location to another with timestamps is used to generate a transition matrix with \
probabilities. Based on those probabilities the simulation of customers in a supermarket  \
has been realized. In this project the main focus was on sales based on bought and stolen  \
articles.
